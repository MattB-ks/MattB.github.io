# 01-Project-Family-Reunion

## Description
	
	A page to RSVP for a family reunion. Features to include location image carousel, a form to join family newsletter, confirm if you are coming to the reunion, and number of people you are bringing.  

	The motivation for this project was Coltonâ€™s upcoming family reunion that will take place in the summer of 2025.  

	We built this project so that family members have a central location where they can share information and interact with each other. Whether they can attend or not, all family members can connect and participate.

	This website saves time and effort by connecting everyone together and eliminates the problem of family members not receiving the most up-to-date information.

	We learned how to use the Bootstrap CSS framework and how to merge our changes from our branches.

## Installation
	
	There are no special installation requirements to utilize this website.

## Usage

	Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

	To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
